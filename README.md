# US Bank's Home Price Appreciation Model

US Bank's Home Price Appreciation model examines the relationship between price dynamics in the housing market relative to supply and demand forces, motivated by classical economic theory. This paper investigates the applicability and universality of this existing price model by examining its generalizations. Additionally, this paper establishes a better understanding of the model, its limitations, and potential avenues for improvement.

Reliable and sound models for home prices are critical inputs to downstream mortgage prepayment models. Prepayment models inform investment portfolio decision-making and interest rate risk hedging action, highlighting the importance of this model for US Bank's Corporate Treasury.
